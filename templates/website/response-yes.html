        <p>That's great! We're glad to hear you got a response from
            your representative.</p>

        <p>There's just one more thing we'd like to know.</p>

        <h3>Is this the first time youâ€™ve ever contacted one of your
            political representatives, by any means?</h3>

        <p>Why are we being so nosey? Well, one of our aims is to convince
            politicians that, used wisely, the Web can encourage much greater
            participation in the democratic process.</p>

        <p>Thanks again for your feedback.</p>
